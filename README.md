## 👋 Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my **Employee Management System** project!  
This application has been built entirely from scratch, with a strong focus on **functionality** as compared to design. Every component has been custom-coded to showcase a hands-on  learning experience and complete control over the app’s features.

I’ve deployed the project using Netlify so you can check it out from a UI perspective here:
